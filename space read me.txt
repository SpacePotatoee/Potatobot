if you want to add a new item to the faq you MUST use this format 

"simple id for a name (preferably no spaces)":{
    "fields":[{
        "name":"Question name",
        "value":"Answer"
    }]
},

you can add as many fields as you want

    },{
        "name":"Question name",

    },{
        "name":"Question name",
